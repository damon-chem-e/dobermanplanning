Are there areas in north Florida that have mountains and beach and low COL
Short answer: No -- north Florida does not have true mountains. The region's highest elevations are modest hills, with the tallest natural point (Britton Hill, near the Alabama border) rising only about 345 feet above sea level, making it the lowest "state high point" in the United States rather than a mountain range. Wikipedia However, if your priorities are beach access, some higher terrain/rolling hills, and relatively low cost of living (COL), there are parts of northwestern Florida (the Panhandle and Big Bend region) that check several--but not all--of those boxes.
1. Topography in North Florida
No true mountains: Florida, including north Florida, is extremely flat compared with most of the U.S.; the highest natural point (Britton Hill) is 345 ft above sea level. That's more of a hill than a mountain. Wikipedia Rolling hills and uplands: There are higher ridges and hills (e.g., High Hill at ~323 ft), especially in the Northern Highlands around Walton and Washington Counties, but these are gentle terrain rather than mountainous landscapes. Wikipedia
2. Regions in North/Northwest Florida with Natural Features + Beach Access
A. Florida Panhandle (northwest)
Character: Long white-sand Gulf beaches, forests, rolling inland hills, and rural landscapes. Beaches: Stretch from Pensacola Beach to Panama City and beyond. Redfin Hills/Uplands: The Northern Highlands around Walton/Washington counties offer the highest elevations in Florida (still modest hills). Wikipedia Notable towns & inland areas with low COL potential: Marianna, DeFuniak Springs, Chipley, and Valparaiso often show more affordable housing compared with coastal hotspots like Destin/Pensacola proper.
Redfin
DeFuniak Springs: Historic small town inland with access to lakes and within ~45­60 minutes of the Gulf. Redfin Marianna: Very affordable by Florida standards and close to natural areas (including Florida Caverns State Park). Redfin Valparaiso: Near Destin's beaches but with lower housing costs inland. Redfin Note: "Mountains" here means rolling hills, not alpine terrain.
B. Big Bend (northeast of the Panhandle)
Character: Quiet coastal bends, rivers, springs, and marshlands rather than dramatic elevation.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Beaches & Nature: Places like Apalachicola and Carrabelle offer Gulf access with historic charm.
Florida Back Roa...
Terrain: More flat to gently rolling, best for kayaking, fishing, and wildlife viewing rather than hiking elevation.
Florida Back Roa...
C. North/Central Florida (outside Panhandle)
Regions like Lake Wales Ridge further south have minor hills (e.g., Sugarloaf Mountain at ~312 ft), but these are distant from major northern beaches. Wikipedia Typically have lower COL than coastal areas, but beach access requires a longer drive (1.5­3+ hours).

3. Cost of Living & Housing Considerations
Panhandle towns often cheaper than major Florida beach cities like Naples or Miami, with median home prices in some inland communities well below the state average. Redfin Moving slightly inland from the coast generally lowers housing and insurance costs, though this increases your commute to beaches. Gino Santarossa Examples of relatively affordable areas with some outdoor appeal: Marianna: Low median housing prices and access to inland natural parks. Redfin DeFuniak Springs / Chipley: Smaller towns with classic "Florida small-town" feel not far from beaches.
Redfin
Valparaiso / Brent: Near Destin/Pensacola beaches but often with lower housing costs inland. Redfin

If your definition of "mountains" includes noticeable hills and scenic terrain, then northern Florida's Panhandle highlands and areas around the Northern Highlands offer the closest match. For actual elevation changes and more dramatic hiking terrain, you'd need to look west into Alabama/Georgia foothills or farther north into Tennessee/North Carolina, where true mountains exist.
What about Oregon? Also factor in taxes into COL. think of other states also
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Oregon: mountains + beach + taxes (part of COL)
Geography fit Oregon is one of the better "mountains + beach" states because the Coast Range is immediately inland from the Pacific, and the Cascades are reachable (often ~1.5­3.5 hours from many coastal towns, depending on where). The "mountains" are real (unlike Florida).
Tax mix (how it tends to hit COL) No general sales tax (big day-to-day COL advantage). Oregon +1 Higher state income tax relative to many "low-tax" states (top bracket is commonly cited at 9.9%).
Oregon +2
Property taxes are "middle-ish" nationally by effective rate (roughly ~0.7­0.8% in common comparisons), but vary by county/city. Tax Foundation +1 What that means practically If you're a higher earner, Oregon's income tax can outweigh the "no sales tax" benefit. If your income is moderate and you spend a lot on taxable goods/services, the no sales tax can be meaningful. Oregon areas that best match your criteria (generally) South Coast / smaller coastal metros: often cheaper than the Portland metro and some marquee tourist towns.
Examples to evaluate: Coos Bay­North Bend, Reedsport, Florence (varies), some inland-adjacent communities that are still close to the ocean. Inland-but-near-coast towns (lower housing pressure than beachfront, still close to both coast range hiking and the ocean): Examples: Tillamook area, Astoria-area inland, valley towns that are 30­60 minutes to the beach. Caution: Some coastal/tourist markets can be expensive despite being "rural." The Oregon Coast is a destination region, so the "low COL" part depends heavily on the specific town and housing/insurance costs.
Other states to consider (with taxes explicitly in the mix)
Below are the most common "mountains + beach" contenders, with how the tax structure tends to change COL.
1) Washington (strong geography; tax trade-offs)
Geography: excellent (Olympics/Cascades + Pacific coast).
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Taxes: no wage income tax, but sales tax (state + local) is material and varies by location.
Washington Dep... +1
COL reality: can be high near Seattle; more moderate in some coastal/inland areas (but inventory is limited and weather is gray/wet). Good "value-search" zones: Olympic Peninsula (Port Angeles / surrounding), Aberdeen­Hoquiam, some southwest WA communities--each with different job-market realities.
2) Alabama (best "low COL" profile; mountains are smaller)
Geography: has Appalachian foothills in the north and Gulf beaches in the south (but you're typically hours from one to the other). Taxes: state income tax tops out at 5%; property taxes are among the lowest nationally.
Alabama Depart... +1
Trade-off: combined sales taxes can be high in many areas (state + locals), so spending patterns matter. (If you want, I can quantify this by county/city once you name places.)
3) North Carolina (good balance; distance is the issue)
Geography: real mountains (western NC) + beaches (Outer Banks / coast), but typically 4­6 hours apart. Taxes: flat individual income tax rate scheduled at 3.99% for tax year 2026. NCDOR COL: can be attractive in many small/medium metros; housing has risen in the most in-demand areas.
4) New Hampshire (surprisingly strong tax angle; COL varies)
Geography: White Mountains + small Atlantic coastline (not huge beaches, but it is ocean). Taxes: no tax on W-2 wages, and the Interest & Dividends tax is repealed starting 2025.
NH Revenue Ad... +1
Watch-outs: property taxes can be high in many towns, and housing can be pricey relative to "low COL" states.
5) Maine / Virginia (honorable mentions)
Maine: coastline + mountains, but taxes and heating costs can be meaningful; COL varies widely. Virginia: mountains + coast (VA Beach), but not typically "low COL" in many coastal job markets.
If you tell me two things, I can narrow this to a short list
1. Your income situation (rough household income band, and whether it's W-2 vs self-employed/retired), and 2. Whether you need to be within 30­60 minutes of the beach (daily access) or if 2­4 hours (weekend
access) is acceptable. With that, I can recommend a handful of specific metros/town clusters in Oregon and 2­3 other states that best match "mountains + beach + lower all-in tax-adjusted COL," and explain the trade-offs plainly.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Very high earner, self employed. Weekend beach access acceptable. Ideally within 1 hour of both beach and mountains, and 1-2 hour out from a metropolitan area.
Given your constraints (very high earner, self-employed; weekend beach acceptable; ideally ~1 hour to both beach and mountains; and ~1­2 hours to a metro), the limiting factor is taxes. For a very high earner, the states that most consistently "win" are those with no broad wage/earned-income tax--but you still need real mountains and some kind of ocean access. Below are the best matches and then the near-misses (good geography, but the tax math usually loses at your income level).
Best overall fit: Washington (mountains + coast + no wage income tax)
Why Washington tends to win for you
No Washington state tax on wage/earned income (material for a very high earner). SmartAsset +1 You do, however, need to plan around Washington's long-term capital gains tax (important for founders/investors/self-employed with liquidity events):
WA DOR describes a 7% capital gains tax on certain long-term capital asset sales, with an additional tier that can apply at higher levels. Washington Dep... +1 WA also has meaningful sales tax (state + local varies by location). The WA DOR maintains the local rate tables. Washington Dep...
Best Washington "geo + access" zones (that actually meet your drive-time intent)
1) Olympic Peninsula (Port Angeles / Sequim / Port Townsend) Mountains: Olympic Mountains are right there (true mountain terrain; hiking, alpine-ish routes). Beach/coast: Pacific beaches + Strait of Juan de Fuca access; many coastal points are well within weekend distance. Metro access: Typically ~1.5­2.5 hours to Seattle metro depending on ferry/route and traffic (fits your 1­ 2 hour goal on the faster days; can be longer on peak travel days). Tax-adjusted COL: Often better than Seattle proper, though housing supply can be tight.
Why it aligns with your "1 hour to beach + mountains" goal: on the Peninsula you can often be close to both water and mountains without living in an expensive metro core.
2) South Puget Sound / Tacoma fringe (Gig Harbor, Key Peninsula, Kitsap edges) Mountains: Rainier and Olympics are reachable; you're closer to "big city" services. Water/beach: Puget Sound beaches are nearby (not "Pacific surf," but shoreline access is immediate). Metro access: Seattle/Tacoma amenities are within your 1­2 hour window (often much less).
This is a strong "high-earner practicality" choice: good airports, healthcare, and services, while keeping state income tax at zero.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Self-employed note (Washington-specific): Washington's business tax regime relies heavily on gross receipts (B&O tax) rather than income, so your structure and revenue type matter materially. That is separate from your personal tax picture and worth modeling with your CPA.
Best "tax" state with mountains + coast, but geography is harder: New Hampshire (and nearby Maine)
New Hampshire tax reality
New Hampshire does not tax wage/earned income, and the state's Interest & Dividends tax is repealed for tax periods beginning on/after Jan 1, 2025. NH Revenue Ad... +1
Geography reality vs your drive-time goals
NH Seacoast (Portsmouth area) gives you real ocean access quickly, and Boston metro is roughly within your 1­2 hour target. The challenge: the White Mountains are usually more like ~2+ hours from the Seacoast, so it often misses your "~1 hour to mountains" preference. How people make it work anyway: Live inland a bit (southern NH towns) to shorten mountain access, accept that the "beach" is more of a weekend drive than an hour.
Near-miss (great geography, usually poor for very high earners): Oregon
Oregon is excellent for "coast + mountains," but for a very high earner the tax math is usually unfavorable because: Oregon has no sales tax, but it does have a progressive individual income tax with a top marginal rate of 9.9%. Tax Foundation +1
For a very high earner, the state income tax typically overwhelms the benefit of "no sales tax" unless your taxable income is structured unusually (and even then, residency rules are strict--this is CPA/attorney territory, not DIY).
Other states worth mentioning (mostly fail your "beach + mountains within ~1 hour" constraint)
California: Many areas can achieve "mountains + coast" within an hour, but taxes are generally high for very high earners. Alaska: Mountains + water are easy; "metro" is limited (Anchorage), and logistics are different. No-income-tax states like TN/TX/FL: taxes can be attractive, but they fail the "real mountains + ocean beach" requirement (or the distances are too large).
Bottom line shortlist (based on your constraints)
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

1. Washington ­ Olympic Peninsula (best match for your geography + tax profile; watch WA capital gains rules and your business tax profile). Washington Dep... +2
2. Washington ­ South Puget Sound fringe (best "services + airports + no wage income tax" blend; water access immediate; mountains reachable). SmartAsset +1
3. New Hampshire (southern / seacoast) as a tax-strong alternative, accepting that "within 1 hour to mountains" is hard from the coast. NH Revenue Ad... +1
If you want, I can narrow to 4­6 specific town clusters
Tell me only: Are you optimizing for Pacific surf/ocean beaches specifically, or is sound/strait shoreline acceptable? Do you anticipate large capital gains events (business sale, concentrated stock, etc.) in the next 3­5 years?
I'll then rank the top Washington sub-regions for you and outline the tax landmines (capital gains exposure, B&O exposure, local sales/property pressures) in plain English.
I don't need to drive anywhere, I work from home. Also, my income is from trading. I plan to create some form of prop trading LLC that holds the profits within itself and I take a salary from that initially, but eventually I just have that llc with profits turned into safe treasuries, then take out loans for expenses (borrow, die, repeat). So ideally this helps cut the taxes problem. What is your best bet now? I like the Alabama and South Carolina ideas. I also like the Oregon / Washington ideas.
Understood. Given that clarification, the problem simplifies materially: You are location-agnostic for work Income is trading-derived, not wages You intend to retain profits in an LLC, later shift to treasuries + asset-backed borrowing You are optimizing for lifestyle geography first, then minimizing unavoidable taxes, not headline marginal rates Weekend access is fine; daily commuting is irrelevant
That changes the answer substantially. Below is a clean, high-confidence ranking of your best options, followed by why each works specifically for your structure.
Executive Summary -- Best Bets (in order)
1. Washington (Olympic Peninsula / South Puget Sound fringe) 2. Alabama (North Alabama foothills or inland Gulf side) 3. South Carolina (Upstate SC near Greenville, not the coast itself)
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

4. Oregon (only if you strongly prefer the lifestyle and accept the tradeoffs)

1. Washington -- Best overall for your plan
Why Washington works specifically for a trader + asset-holding LLC
Taxes No state tax on ordinary income (salary, pass-through income) No state tax on interest income from Treasuries No estate tax planning gimmicks required at your level (though WA does have one, it is manageable with trusts)
Capital gains caveat (important but manageable) Washington's capital gains tax applies to certain realized long-term capital gains, not to: Unrealized gains Interest from Treasuries Borrowed funds If your strategy is retain  buy Treasuries  borrow, the CG tax becomes largely irrelevant unless you intentionally realize gains
This makes Washington unusually compatible with "retain capital + borrow against assets" strategies. LLC / entity considerations
Washington uses a gross receipts (B&O) tax, but: Trading activity often qualifies under financial activity classifications At scale, this is usually less painful than income tax, especially with planning This is solvable with entity structuring; it is not a deal-breaker
Geography fit (very strong)
Olympic Peninsula: real mountains + real ocean Puget Sound fringe: water everywhere; Cascades and Olympics both accessible You can live rural, scenic, quiet and still reach a metro (Seattle/Tacoma) in ~1.5­2 hours when needed Bottom line: For a high-net-worth trader using deferral + borrowing, Washington is the strongest overall alignment of tax mechanics and lifestyle among all states you mentioned.

2. Alabama -- Quietly excellent for low-friction living

Why Alabama works better than people expect

Taxes

 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Low top income tax rate Extremely low property taxes No wealth tax, no complex capital regime For your strategy, Alabama's biggest advantage is simplicity: No aggressive enforcement posture No exotic capital gains rules Easy to operate an LLC quietly If your realized income becomes very low (because you borrow instead), Alabama becomes almost frictionless. Geography reality North Alabama has Appalachian foothills (not Rockies, but real elevation and terrain) Gulf beaches are 3­4 hours, which is acceptable for weekend use Lake Guntersville / Little River Canyon area is one of the most underrated outdoor regions east of the Mississippi Tradeoff You do not get beach + mountains within 1 hour Cultural / social scene is quieter and more traditional Bottom line: Alabama is a low-drama, low-cost, low-attention state that pairs well with asset preservation and privacy.
3. South Carolina -- Upstate, not coastal
Why SC is interesting for you
Taxes Moderate income tax, but: Capital income treatment is more flexible than headline rates suggest Friendly to trusts and entity-based planning No extreme enforcement culture
Geography Upstate SC (Greenville / Travelers Rest area): Blue Ridge Mountains within minutes Coast is ~3 hours (Charleston / Beaufort) Greenville gives you a clean, functional metro without the dysfunction of major coastal cities
Tradeoff Coast is not close enough to feel "dual-access" Weather is humid in summer (less so than Alabama)
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Bottom line: SC is a balanced, civilized option if you want mountains first and beach second, with reasonable taxes and good livability.
4. Oregon -- Lifestyle win, tax friction risk
Why Oregon is last despite excellent geography
Oregon is phenomenal geographically -- arguably the best coast + mountain combo in the lower 48. However:
High state income tax Aggressive residency and sourcing rules Less tolerant of "paper income minimization" strategies than Alabama or SC Works only if:
You are extremely disciplined about realization You accept higher compliance risk If you emotionally prefer Oregon, it can work -- but it is not the cleanest match for your stated financial strategy.
Final Recommendation
If I had to choose one state given everything you've said: Washington -- Olympic Peninsula or Puget Sound fringe
It offers: The best alignment with deferred realization + asset-backed borrowing No income tax drag while you are alive and compounding Real mountains, real water, real isolation Sufficient proximity to a major metro when needed High-quality infrastructure and healthcare without daily exposure
Next Step (optional but high value)
If you want, I can: Compare specific counties (property tax, insurance, enforcement posture) Flag Washington-specific traps for traders (capital gains thresholds, B&O nuances) Propose a "location + entity" pairing (e.g., where to domicile the LLC vs where you personally reside)
Just tell me whether you are prioritizing: 1. Maximum privacy, or
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

2. Maximum outdoor beauty, or 3. Maximum legal simplicity The answer changes slightly depending on which one you rank first.
Note that capital gains will primarily be short term. Holding periods on seconds, minutes, days depending on trade. Weeks to months or longer will be likely in minority of trades. Does that affect your answer?
I prefer privacy, legal and tax simplicity, and good COL. coparent prioritizes outdoor beauty including beach and mountains and metropolitan access.
Short answer: yes, the fact that your gains are overwhelmingly short-term materially strengthens Washington and weakens Oregon, while Alabama and South Carolina remain viable but for different reasons. Your stated preferences (privacy, legal/tax simplicity, good COL, co-parent values scenery + metro access) narrow this to two realistic winners and one compromise option. I will be direct and structured.
Key technical implication of short-term trading income
How states actually treat your income
Short-term trading gains are treated as ordinary income, not capital gains, in every state. That means:
Washington No personal income tax  short-term gains are untaxed at the state level Washington's capital gains tax does NOT apply to short-term gains Your clarification removes the single biggest WA concern
Oregon Short-term gains taxed as ordinary income  top marginal rate up to 9.9% Oregon becomes structurally unfavorable for an active trader
Alabama / South Carolina Short-term gains taxed as ordinary income Rates are materially lower and enforcement posture is lighter
This single fact locks Oregon into last place for your profile.
Priority alignment (your stated preferences)
You ranked: 1. Privacy
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

2. Legal + tax simplicity 3. Good COL 4. Co-parent: outdoor beauty (mountains + beach) + metro access No state perfectly maximizes all four, so the question is which state dominates most dimensions without fatally failing one.
Best overall fit: Washington (Olympic Peninsula or Puget Sound fringe)
Why Washington now clearly rises to #1
Taxes (now decisively in your favor) 0% state tax on short-term trading income Capital gains tax irrelevant given your holding periods Interest from Treasuries not taxed at state level Borrow-against-assets strategy fits cleanly
You are effectively operating in a no-income-tax jurisdiction for your actual cash flow.
Privacy & enforcement Washington is not low-regulation, but it is predictable No "hunting behavior" toward traders comparable to CA or NY Far less cultural scrutiny than Oregon or California
Legal / operational reality The B&O (gross receipts) tax exists, but: Applies at low effective rates for financial activity Is simpler than income tax audits Can be planned around structurally
COL Outside Seattle proper, COL drops sharply Peninsula and fringe Puget Sound towns are reasonable relative to quality of life Property taxes are moderate and transparent
Co-parent lifestyle satisfaction Real mountains + real ocean National-park-level scenery Still within ~1.5­2 hours of a major metro (Seattle / Tacoma) Excellent healthcare and airports when needed
Washington is now the only state that cleanly satisfies both your financial structure and your coparent's lifestyle priorities.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Strong secondary option: Alabama (North Alabama foothills)
Why Alabama remains compelling
Privacy & simplicity (Alabama's biggest strength) Extremely low enforcement aggressiveness Simple tax code Minimal regulatory friction Quiet jurisdiction for asset accumulation
Taxes Short-term gains taxed, but at low marginal rates Very low property taxes No complex capital overlays
If your realized income becomes minimal due to borrowing, Alabama's tax drag approaches zero in practice.
COL Excellent Insurance, property, services all materially cheaper than West Coast
Geography (the tradeoff) Mountains are foothills (Appalachian, not alpine) Beach is 3­4 hours, not 1 hour Less dramatic scenery than WA
Co-parent reality Outdoor access is good, but not awe-level Metro access is limited (Huntsville / Birmingham are functional, not cultural magnets)
Alabama is the "low-friction, high-privacy" choice, but it does not fully satisfy the shared lifestyle vision.
Tertiary / compromise option: South Carolina (Upstate, Greenville area)
Why SC sits between WA and AL
Taxes Moderate income tax on short-term gains Reasonable treatment of entities and trusts Less aggressive than Oregon or California
Privacy
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Better than Oregon Slightly worse than Alabama Still generally business-friendly
Geography Mountains immediately Coast ~3 hours Greenville is a genuinely pleasant small metro
SC works if: Mountains matter more day-to-day Beach is strictly a weekend destination You want East Coast culture without Northeast taxes
Explicitly ruled out: Oregon
Despite excellent geography, Oregon fails your stated priorities: High income tax on short-term gains Aggressive residency enforcement Poor match for active trading Complexity without offsetting tax benefit
For your strategy, Oregon only works if emotionally preferred, not rationally optimal.
Final recommendation (clean answer)
Primary recommendation
Washington -- Olympic Peninsula or Puget Sound fringe This best satisfies:
Your short-term trading income profile Privacy and legal predictability Tax minimization without gimmicks Co-parent's outdoor + metro preferences
Backup if you want maximum quiet and minimal scrutiny
North Alabama (foothills)
Backup if mountains > ocean and East Coast culture matters
Upstate South Carolina (Greenville area)

Next step (optional, high value)
If you want, I can: Compare specific counties in Washington vs Alabama on: Property tax Insurance Audit/enforcement culture Suggest residency + LLC domicile combinations Stress-test your plan against worst-case scenarios (forced realization, liquidity event, audit)
If you do that, tell me which state you want to drill into first.
Ya go ahead with the specific counties in Washington and with the llc domicile stuff
Yes--if you will be physically resident in Washington and doing the trading activity from your home office, then the county/city you choose (and whether you try to "domicile" the LLC elsewhere) becomes mostly a question of: 1. personal residency (where you live), 2. where the business is considered to be "doing business," and 3. how much compliance complexity you're willing to tolerate for privacy. Below I'll give you: (A) specific WA counties that best match your priorities, then (B) the LLC domicile playbook (what works, what doesn't, and "best simplicity" structures).
A) Washington counties that best fit your priorities
What you're optimizing for (per your criteria)
Privacy + quiet: fewer neighbors, fewer visitors, fewer local compliance "surprises" Legal/tax simplicity: minimize city-level taxes/licensing and multi-jurisdiction headaches Good COL: avoid core Seattle/Eastside pricing Co-parent: real mountains + real coastline + metro access (1­2 hours)
Tier 1: Best balance of privacy, scenery, and access
1) Clallam County (Sequim / Port Angeles area) Why it fits
You are on the Olympic Peninsula, so "mountains and coast" is not a marketing line--it's the actual geography. Strong privacy characteristics (lower density) without being completely isolated. Practical access to services (Port Angeles is a service hub).
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Tradeoffs Healthcare/specialists and airport access are "good enough," not Seattle-level. Ferry logistics can add time/cost for metro trips.
2) Jefferson County (Port Townsend / inland-rural Jefferson) Why it fits
High "outdoor beauty" satisfaction (very strong for co-parent). Privacy can be excellent depending on how rural you go. Still reasonably connected to the Seattle orbit (often via ferry/drive). Tradeoffs Some pockets are pricey by Peninsula standards (Port Townsend is desirable). Inventory can be constrained. Property tax note (county selection): levy rates vary materially by county and taxing district; WA DOR publishes county levy-rate data and statistics to compare counties apples-to-apples. Washington Dep... +1
Tier 2: "Practical Washington" (more services, still scenic) 3) Kitsap County (Poulsbo / Kingston / north Kitsap; not Bremerton core)
Why it fits Very strong "1­2 hours to metro" performance (Seattle access via ferry; Tacoma via drive). Water everywhere; mountains reachable (Olympics/Cascades). More services and better logistics than the Peninsula counties while still offering privacy in the right pockets.
Tradeoffs Some areas are increasingly popular and can feel less "private" unless you pick carefully.
4) Mason County (Hood Canal side) Why it fits
Excellent privacy/COL profile in many areas. Outdoor access is very strong (water + Olympics nearby). Metro access is typically manageable (Tacoma/Olympia axis). Tradeoffs Rural services; you'll drive for higher-end amenities.
Tier 3: "Metro-adjacent but not metro-priced"
5) Thurston County (outside Olympia core) Why it fits
If you need "easy mode" access to services (medical, legal, airport drives), Thurston is convenient.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Still close to mountains/water, though the "coast" is more of a true weekend run. Tradeoffs
Less dramatic scenery than Clallam/Jefferson/Mason/Kitsap.
Counties I would deprioritize for your stated goals
King County (COL, density, and higher likelihood of city-level tax/licensing complexity) Snohomish / Pierce (many parts) (can work, but you'll fight COL or sprawl; better as "access-first" choices than privacy-first)
B) LLC domicile and "what actually works" if you live in Washington
1) The core rule: forming the LLC elsewhere does not, by itself, remove Washington obligations
Washington's key business tax is the B&O tax, which is a gross receipts tax (not an income tax).
Washington Dep... +1
If you are physically in Washington performing the activity, Washington can treat the business as doing business in Washington--regardless of whether the LLC was formed in Wyoming/Delaware/etc.
2) If you form the LLC in Wyoming/Delaware/Nevada but operate from WA, you usually must register as a foreign LLC in WA
Washington's SOS requires foreign (non-WA) LLCs to register, and the filing process requires a Certificate of Existence/Good Standing dated within 60 days. WA Secretary of... +1 So the "out-of-state LLC" path often results in:
WY/DE LLC formation + annual maintenance WA foreign registration + WA ongoing compliance plus any WA DOR licensing (UBI, etc.) That is the opposite of simplicity.
3) You will almost certainly need a WA business license/UBI anyway
Washington DOR's business license process assigns a UBI number used for filing/administration.
Washington Dep... +1
The best "simplicity + privacy" structures for a WA resident trader
Option A (Best simplicity; often best overall): Single Washington LLC
Structure You personally live in WA. You form a WA LLC, get the WA business license/UBI, and run trading activity there.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Why this is usually best One jurisdiction to maintain for the entity formation No foreign registration complexity Cleanest for banks, brokers, mortgages, underwriting
Privacy improvement without multi-state structure Use a professional registered agent (your address is less exposed in public records in practice). Avoid operating from a city with extra business tax layers where possible.
Option B (Privacy-leaning but more complexity): WY holding company + WA operating LLC
Structure WY LLC = holding/ownership entity (manages ownership interests) WA LLC = operating entity (where you live and trade) WY holding owns WA operating.
What you gain Slightly improved public-facing privacy in some contexts (depends on what's publicly searchable and how you structure managers/members).
What you pay Two entities, two states, more filings, more accounting complexity Still no escape from WA "doing business" realities because the operating activity is in WA
This can be worth it only if you have a strong privacy driver and competent legal/accounting support.
Option C (What I would not recommend for your stated priorities): Only a WY/DE LLC, registered as foreign in WA
This is typically the worst of both worlds: You still have WA compliance You add another state's fees/filings And you rarely get meaningful tax savings from it if the activity is in WA
City-level tax trap to actively avoid (important)
Even if the state picture is favorable, some cities impose their own gross-receipts style taxes (local B&O). Seattle is the big one. Beginning January 1, 2026, Seattle's B&O threshold increases to $2 million (below that, no Seattle B&O owed, though filing/reporting may still be required). Seattle +1 Practical implication:
If you want maximum simplicity, do not place your home office/address inside a city with an additional business tax regime unless you've modeled it.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Privacy reality check: "BOI/CTA" and what's current
As of FinCEN's current BOI guidance, entities created in the U.S. and U.S. beneficial owners are now exempt from BOI reporting (per FinCEN's BOI page update). FinCEN.gov That reduces one common privacy concern, but state public records and registered agent/address choices still matter.
My recommended "best bet" package for you (given your priorities)
If you pick Washington: 1. County short list:
Primary: Clallam, Jefferson Secondary: Mason, north Kitsap (Kitsap County) Practical fallback: Thurston (outside Olympia core) 2. Entity short list: Default: WA LLC only (simplest, usually best) If you truly need extra privacy: WY holding + WA operating LLC Avoid: WY-only + foreign registration in WA (complexity without real benefit) 3. Address strategy: Prefer unincorporated/rural addresses or cities without extra gross receipts taxes Avoid Seattle city limits for maximum simplicity (unless you're under thresholds and comfortable with filings)
If you answer one question, I'll narrow to a concrete "Top 3 county + towns" list
For metro access, do you mean: Seattle/Tacoma specifically, or "any metro" including Bellingham / Olympia / Everett?
Either way, I can give you a very direct "live here, avoid here" set of recommendations.
Give a summary of the cost of living for one adult and one child in these top pick counties. Include housing, utilities, groceries and other common expenses
Here's a data-based cost-of-living summary for a household of one adult + one child in several of the top Washington counties we discussed (Clallam, Kitsap, Mason, and Thurston). I've focused on housing, utilities, groceries, and common expenses (childcare/healthcare) so you can compare realistic monthly/annual budgets rather than broad indices.
 Made by www.chat2pdf.org

Washington State ­ Context
Washington overall has a cost of living above the U.S. average, largely driven by housing. There is no state income tax, which helps high earners, but housing and everyday costs still trend above national norms. SoFi
1) Clallam County (Olympic Peninsula)
Housing Median income guidance suggests ~$36,000/year for a single person and ~$84,960/year for a family to live "comfortably," implying housing + living costs here run somewhat lower than urban WA areas.

Observations & Practical Notes
Housing dominates costs. Even in "lower cost" Washington counties, rents and median home prices are above national norms (though well below Seattle). kitsapeda.org +1 Utilities & groceries tend above U.S. median. Washington's utility bills and grocery costs are often above national averages, particularly in more remote counties where supply costs are higher. SoFi Childcare/healthcare are meaningful line items. Washington's family-care costs can exceed national averages, but public school attendance reduces day-to-day costs once children are school-age. COL relative to Washington high-density regions. All of these counties are materially cheaper than Seattle metro housing and total COL, but still more expensive than many non-West-Coast rural areas.

Summary
Clallam County ­ Lower housing and overall COL than Puget Sound, but still above national medians; good balance of lifestyle + affordability. Kitsap County ­ Higher housing and transportation costs, less privacy; closer to metro amenities. Mason County ­ Middle ground with relative affordable rent/home values and strong privacy. Thurston County ­ Perhaps the best "cost vs services" mix; moderately priced housing, access to a better service base. If you provide an age range for your child (infant, school-age, teen), I can offer a more precise annual budget with childcare/education costs split out.

Can you search for approximate costs for a home with a large multi-car garage with decent outdoor views in one of these counties? Find a few examples with links so I can take a look. Provide estimated monthly mortgage for each.
My goal is to have a large room that is both my personal gym and my workspace that is the size of a multicar garage, has a window to outside (I'll have to renovate that myself if I buy likely since that's not typically built-in).
I don't want a typical suburban area -- I want land around me to a degree.
If you have trouble finding homes themselves, find properties that would work.
For legal / zoning issues, this will be a primary residence.
Below are live listing examples (plus one "sold" comp) that fit your "land + big shop/garage + some views" brief in the WA counties we've been discussing. I'm using a 30-year fixed @ ~6.19% as a baseline for mortgage math (national average per Bankrate, Feb 18, 2026). Bankrate
Assumptions for the mortgage estimates
20% down 30-year fixed, 6.19% Payment shown = principal & interest (P&I) only (tax/insurance/HOA not included unless noted)

Quick reality check on "all-in" monthly cost (not just mortgage)
WA varies by parcel, but a practical underwriting-style ballpark is: Property tax: often roughly 0.8%­1.2% of value/year (very location-dependent) Home insurance: often ~$150­$300/mo (again, property-dependent; acreage/outbuildings can raise it) HOA: usually $0 on rural parcels, but not always (example: the Olympia listing shows an HOA) Realtor
If you want, I can run a second pass where I: filters harder for "detached shop 1,200+ sf" or "RV bay / 4+ car / 30x40+" targets views explicitly (Olympics/Hood Canal/Puget Sound) and gives you 3­5 strongest candidates total rather than a broader menu.
(And if you tell me your preferred price band and whether you'd rather be closer to Seattle/Tacoma or closer to Olympic Peninsula access, I'll bias the search accordingly.)

my favorites here are 77 Road Less Traveled Way Sequim and 222 Towhee Ln, Brinnon reasons: - rural feel, nice views, not feeling 'too polished' or 'too nice' (the mountainside view for 222 towhee ln is especially nice) - no completely separate warehouse feel garage. I want the garage to not feel like a warehouse. It should look nice on the exterior and not be warehouse size, just 2-5 car garage size. Can you find others that are similar with this refinement?
Based on the "rural + views + nice-looking (not warehouse-y) 2­5 car / shop garage" refinement, here are the closest matches I can pull up right now around the same Peninsula submarkets (Sequim / Brinnon / Hood Canal). I'm prioritizing: acreage buffer, non-suburban feel, and a shop/garage that reads like part of a residence (or at least not a metal industrial box).
Closest matches to your favorites (active listings)
1) 77 Road Less Traveled Way, Sequim -- ~5.07 acres + "shop/garage" vibe
Why it matches your vibe: Secluded acreage + river frontage + shop/garage called out prominently; feels "property" not "suburb." Realtor Listing: Realtor Price: $699,950 Realtor Lot: 5.07 acres Realtor Garage/shop: "Garage: 2 cars" and listing notes a "shop/garage" (Zillow/Redfin versions of the listing also describe a finished/heated shop + 2-car garage connection). Realtor Estimated monthly mortgage: $3,836/mo (site estimate) Realtor
2) 222 Towhee Ln, Brinnon -- ~2.5 acres + shop + small garage w/ office above Why it matches your vibe: Wooded + filtered Hood Canal view + shop building + an additional smaller
garage/structure (less "warehouse," more "property outbuildings"). Realtor

Listing: Realtor Price: $425,000 Realtor Lot: 2.5 acres (described in listing text) Realtor Shop/garage: "Nice large shop building... additional small garage with office space above." Realtor Estimated monthly mortgage: $2,257/mo (site estimate; assumes 20% down and shows a ~6.017% 30yr fixed average rate in WA in their calc) Realtor
3) 272434 Highway 101, Sequim -- 2.18 acres + mountain-view feel (good "not suburban" candidate)
Why it's similar: Acreage + "hill or mountain view" flag + quick access to Sequim and the Strait beaches. (Garage/shop details aren't visible in the snippet I could fetch--see note below.) Realtor Listing: Realtor Price: $699,000 Realtor Lot: 2.18 acres Realtor Estimated monthly mortgage: $3,750/mo (site estimate) Realtor
4) "Wildcard" option: 293935 Highway 101, Quilcene -- 2.33 acres + mountain/territorial views (but no garage per listing data)
Why I'm including it: If you're open to building your "gym/work garage" later, this is the right feel--riverfront + acreage + mountain/territorial view. But it's explicitly showing 0 covered spaces. Realtor +1 Listing: Realtor Price: $699,000 Realtor Lot: 2.33 acres Realtor Garage: Covered spaces: 0 Realtor Estimated monthly mortgage: $3,764/mo (site estimate) Realtor
Two other Brinnon-area "property" listings to check (but garage may not be ideal)
These are more "land buffer / rural road" than "designed garage aesthetic," but worth a look if you're flexible: 111 Jaybird Ln, Brinnon -- $374,950, 1.6 acres, but parking shows driveway/RV and doesn't clearly show a real garage count. Redfin +2 81 Seamount Dr, Brinnon -- $680,000, attached 2-car garage, but only 0.27 acres and zoning jurisdiction shows city--so it's likely to feel more "neighborhood" than "land around me." Redfin +2
Quick note on limits (and how to get more of this exact style fast)

I ran into rate-limiting (HTTP 429) while pulling additional Realtor details, so I couldn't verify garage aesthetics/size on as many candidates as I wanted in this pass. If you want to generate a steady pipeline of listings that fit your exact spec, the best filters/search terms that consistently surface your "nice 2­5 car shop/garage, not warehouse" vibe are:
Keywords: "heated shop", "finished shop", "breezeway", "detached garage", "3-car", "RV bay" (sometimes too warehouse-y), "outbuilding", "studio", "bonus room" Hard filters: 1.5­10 acres, no HOA (or minimal), "views: mountain/water/territorial", outside city limits where possible Geography: West/Central Clallam near Sequim foothills + Jefferson north Hood Canal (Brinnon/Quilcene corridor) If you tell me your min acres (e.g., "2+ only") and whether an attached 2­3 car is acceptable if there's also a smaller shop/outbuilding, I'll narrow further and pull the next batch in the same style.
the 222 one is my favorite so far. I would want to renovate that external garage to make it a gym + workspace and run internet cables to it etc. how much do you think that would cost? I would want a lot of windows in it. also, how much do you estimate maintenance for a home that is build in '88 if I want a place to own for the next 20-30 years? is it better to buy someplace that is newer?
Here's a clear, well-reasoned cost framework for renovating the external garage/shop at 222 Towhee Ln, Brinnon into a gym + workspace with lots of windows and infrastructure -- plus expected maintenance costs for a home built in 1988 over a 20­30 year horizon, and how that compares to buying newer.

1) Renovation Estimate to Convert Shop into Gym/Workspace
You want outward aesthetics (lots of windows), structural/workspace upgrades, insulation, and connectivity (power + fiber/electric + HVAC). I'll break this into modules so you can see where the dollars go. Let's assume the existing building is ~600­900 sq ft (typical for the listing description). I'll base rough costs on per-square-foot renovation norms.

A) Structural / Envelope Upgrades

Goal: make the shop comfortable year-round, weather-tight + durable.
