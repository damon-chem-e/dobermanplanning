## Note on making it the Professional Painting

The $30,000 professional painting cost is a one-time upfront expense. To fit this within a 1% budget:
- **Spread over 15 years**: $2,000/year → requires $200K after-tax
- **Spread over 10 years**: $3,000/year → requires $300K after-tax
- **Accelerated (5 years)**: $6,000/year → requires $600K after-tax
