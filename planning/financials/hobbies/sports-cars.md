### Daily Pre-Tax Income Needed

To afford sports cars at the 1% threshold:

| Sports Car Cost | After-Tax Needed | Pre-Tax Needed (252 days) |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| $24,000/yr | $2,400,000 | $8,772/day |
| $30,000/yr | $3,000,000 | $11,127/day |
| $36,000/yr | $3,600,000 | $13,388/day |

## Recommendation

Sports cars are only feasible under the 1% rule at **$2.5M+ after-tax income** (approximately $11,000+/day pre-tax with 252 trading days).

At lower income levels, consider:
- **Used Lotus Evora GT**: Lower purchase price, similar driving experience
- **Other sports cars**: Porsche 718, Toyota GR Supra, BMW Z4 (lower insurance/maintenance)
- **Delay purchase**: Save until income threshold is met
