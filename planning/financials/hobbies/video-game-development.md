| $5,000 | $500,000 |
| $7,500 | $750,000 |
| $10,000 | $1,000,000 |

### Pre-Tax Income Required (252 trading days, $100K deductions)

| After-Tax Target | 1% Budget | Video Game Dev Feasibility |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| $200,000 | $2,000 | ❌ Need $500K (2.5x over) |
| $300,000 | $3,000 | ❌ Need $500K (1.7x over) |
| $500,000 | $5,000 | ✅ At threshold |
| $750,000 | $7,500 | ✅ Affordable |
| $1,000,000 | $10,000 | ✅ Full budget feasible |
| $2,000,000 | $20,000 | ✅ Very comfortable |
| $5,000,000 | $50,000 | ✅ Easily affordable |

### Daily Pre-Tax Income Needed

| Annual Budget | After-Tax Needed | Pre-Tax Needed (252 days) |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| $5,000/yr | $500,000 | $2,768/day |
| $7,500/yr | $750,000 | $4,440/day |
| $10,000/yr | $1,000,000 | $6,116/day |

## Recommendation

Video game development is feasible under the 1% rule at **$500K+ after-tax income** (approximately $2,800+/day pre-tax with 252 trading days).

For high token usage ($10K/yr), the threshold rises to **$1M after-tax** (~$6,100/day pre-tax).
