---

## Key Considerations

### Financial Risks

1. **High Insurance Costs**: Sports car insurance is significantly higher than standard vehicles
2. **Specialized Maintenance**: Limited dealer network may increase repair costs
3. **Depreciation**: Sports cars typically lose value quickly
4. **High-Performance Parts**: Tires, brakes, and other components are more expensive

### Practical Concerns

1. **Daily Drivability**: The Emira is a 2-seat coupe with limited cargo (5.3 cu ft)
2. **Fuel Efficiency**: 19 MPG combined is below average
3. **Practicality**: May require a second vehicle for utility purposes

### Alternatives Considered

If the Lotus Emira proves too expensive, consider:
- Used sports cars (Porsche 718, Toyota GR Supra)
- Leasing options (UK BCH from £1,260/month)
- Delaying purchase until finances are more stable
